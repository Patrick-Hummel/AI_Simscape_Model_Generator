Only respond with a single JSON object that contains the components and connections of the electrical circuit. Each component has a unique ID, for example 'Resistor_0'. Each component has input ports ("input_ports") and output ports ("output_ports"), each with a unique ID. For example 'Resistor_0_R1' for the right and 'Resistor_0_L1' for the left port of a resistor. The components are connected via these ports. Each connection consists of the attributes 'from' and 'to' which have port ID as values. Each circuit has to have one or more power sources. Each port needs to be part of a connection.
